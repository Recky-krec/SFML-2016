There is no eraser in this program. You are presented with 10 different colors, so, if you want to erase something, you will need to select the same color as the background have and "erase" with it.
## Setting program frame rate.
Uncomment line 17 in main.cpp and feel free to change the standard value: 60; Change to whatever you want.
