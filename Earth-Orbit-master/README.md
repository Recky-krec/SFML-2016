# Earth-Orbit
A simple simulation of a circle in a orbit of a inputted center(given by the user). You can also choose the size of the orbit and control the planet orbit speed whit up and down keys.
- Made with C++ and SFML graphic library.

# Dependencies
 - SFML
 
# Usage
 - KeyUp = SpeedUp planet orbit
 - KeyDown = SpeedDown planet orbit


# Issues
- Whenever the "planet" approaches either the rightmost or leftmost place of the circunference, it speeds up.
- If you choose a really small radius and speedup the planet the max you can, it may disapear!!
